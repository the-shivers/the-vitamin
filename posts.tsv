x_1	https://x.com/BarbarianChad/status/1897090360326889702	I find that I'm more likely to be deficient in vitamin D, perhaps like many others, and supplementation helps tremendously
x_1	https://x.com/SimoKohonen/status/1896888227430277626	B12 is a pretty good answer here too
x_1	https://x.com/fearmonger69420/status/1896984412719616202	For me it was Vitamins D and B. Did a blood test in college and it changed my life. I firmly believe this is true for many Americans.

x_1	https://x.com/RezabekA/status/1896900983562911891	for me, it's enough sleep combined with getting the fuck outta my house, or at least getting a morning shower
x_1	https://x.com/jeremyhoffman/status/1896957745842340246	I love my kids but I do miss sleep. One day this year I got to sleep for 10.5 hours. It was incredible. I felt high.
x_1	https://x.com/ErBridgeford/status/1897392051626631661	I wonder if mine was magnesium. I had a liver transplant a few years ago and feel great all the time now. It could be that I spent 4 years slowly dying. But I also have to take an ungodly amount of magnesium now because of medication side effects.
x_1	https://x.com/Bobbertfrasier/status/1897124865007845687	for me it was adderall

x_1	https://x.com/OliverBarnum/status/1896968042653077570	I got diagnosed with a neurological sleep disorder, so this basically happened to me. Now my sleep is correct and it turns out I did everything while so tired I might have registered as drunk.
x_3	https://x.com/sympatheticopp/status/1980313229382545608	creatine is weirdly hard to ecplain. the best thing i can say is that to me, creatine is The Vitamin

x_3	https://x.com/OlLadyOfTheLake/status/1980404898832478390	For me it was folate and Vitamin A. Apparently I'm bad at making them on my own.

x_3	https://x.com/mylifeisaplague/status/1980846546251051287	I believe it's sodium for me
x_3	https://x.com/frrntc/status/1981326254487023944	for me the vitamin was magnesium then i saw massive benefits from vitamin D milk and iron and then even more benefit from creatine. plus good sleep that‚Äôs a requirement.
x_3	https://x.com/canering/status/1980511802200068144	This actually happened to me and it turns out I‚Äôm severely anemic After some iron infusions I do feel better but it‚Äôs more like, I don‚Äôt pass out when standing up anymore, my life has otherwise not improved much cuz it‚Äôs not magic unfortunately Taking adderall (as prescribed and in moderation, not like a manic college finals week binge) did actually have a magical effect though, finally being able to function like a regular person on a daily basis
x_3	https://x.com/SpliceEye/status/1980607772501692471	This was me with an undiagnosed wheat allergy
x_3	https://x.com/Crypto__NoYogi/status/1980692508569960521	I was severely deficient in B12. For some reason my stomach decided it couldn't absorb it anymore (likely alcohol abuse although it manifested while I was 1 yr sober) It caused all kinds of terrifying neurological issues, one of which was that I slowly became retarded.
x_3	https://x.com/l_white_rekords/status/1980387225260167662	It's cocaine

If you are one of the approximately 10% of people with this mutation, your body has difficulty converting folic acid (Vitamin B9) to its active form, methylfolate. People with this mutation who supplement with methylfolate often report major improvements in mood and concentration.

x_11	https://x.com/SlaterHeil/status/1900647841409671355	Yes  It's a very holistic change as much mental as physical  Food, exercise, extremely ambitious goals and constant 'do something' mindset  Lifting was most important because it builds testosterone, and testosterone literally makes your BRAIN feel GOOD for accomplishing things with EFFORT  That association drives doing more things. Becoming a person that does more things with big impact makes you high energy naturally  It all feeds into itself.  Foundation = lots of lifting / pushing self as a habit Great food Lots of big stuff to accomplish Discipline  You will feel like a totally new person and as the system starts working together, your brain will require and it will only feel good to do things, and your body will start producing insane amounts of energy  Good way to kick start is a hard commit to the 75 Hard program

Healthy diet, biggest thing is cutting out sugar and inflammatory foods. 3. Exercise, CrossFit for me is the most challenging thing I've come across, but do what works for you, both aerobic and anaerobic exercises.  Active stretching like Functional Range Conditioning also solid. 4. Meditation, probably the hardest thing for me is settling the mind on a single focal point.  5. Supplements.  Biggest impact for me was mitochondria support (CoQ10 is good) and antioxidants.   6. Low to zero caffeine.   Getting into a regular routine with all of this, takes a bit of time and dedication, but I feel so freaking good throughout my day compared to 5 years ago.
