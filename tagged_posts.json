Becoming a person that does more things with big impact makes you high energy naturally  It all feeds into itself.  Foundation = lots of lifting / pushing self as a habit Great food Lots of big stuff to accomplish Discipline  You will feel like a totally new person and as the system starts working together, your brain will require and it will only feel good to do things, and your body will start producing insane amounts of energy  Good way to kick start is a hard commit to the 75 Hard program"

Exercise, CrossFit for me is the most challenging thing I've come across, but do what works for you, both aerobic and anaerobic exercises.  Active stretching like Functional Range Conditioning also solid. 4. Meditation, probably the hardest thing for me is settling the mind on a single focal point.  5. Supplements.  Biggest impact for me was mitochondria support (CoQ10 is good) and antioxidants.   6. Low to zero caffeine.   Getting into a regular routine with all of this, takes a bit of time and dedication, but I feel so freaking good throughout my day compared to 5 years ago. "
